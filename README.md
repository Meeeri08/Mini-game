# Mini-game: 3 Shot Battle

3 Shot Battle is a small game project created with the SDL bases we've learnt in the Project 1 subject at the Videogame Design and Development Degree (CITM, UPC).

In it, 2 players fight for survival, they each have 3 lifes and each can only have 3 shots on screen, otherwise the older ones will de-spawn.

## Controls

### Player 1

* **W, A, S, D keys** to move.
* **K** to shoot to the right. 
* **J** to shoot downwards.
* **H** to shoot to the left.
* **U** to shoot upwards.

## Player 2

* **Arrow keys** to move.
* **6** in the num pad to shoot to the right. 
* **5** in the num pad to shoot downwards.
* **4** in the num pad to shoot to the left.
* **8** in the num pad oot upwards.

## General Info

* When a player looses a life one of their hearts empties.
* When one of the players wins the game will stop and display said winner on the **ndow title**.
